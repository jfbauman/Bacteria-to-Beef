## Bacteria to Beef
In this module Roza, a biological researcher discovers and documents unknown bacteria. She is able to synthesize proteins that taste like beef from things like micro organisms, algae and fungus. Humans house many different species of bacteria in thier gut, eyelashed and belly buttons. The bacterial species found in human belly buttons are ideal to make synthetic beef. 
Roza conducted a study and each research participant has an ID#. We built a dashboard where researchers and research participants can go to search by participant ID# in the dropdown menu to view results and demographics. The dashboard contains dynamic charts to show the top 10 most common species of bacteria, belly button washing frequency and bacteria cultures per sample.
